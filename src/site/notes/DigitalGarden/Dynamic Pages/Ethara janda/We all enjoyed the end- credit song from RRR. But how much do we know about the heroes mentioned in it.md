##### We all enjoyed the end- credit song from RRR. But how much do we know about the heroes mentioned in it?
Well, I'm sure we can recognise some faces if not all. Netaji Subhash Chandrabose, Sardar Vallabhai Patel, Bhagath Singh, Chhathrapathi Shivaji, and Tangutoori Prakaasam Panthulu (though only a few people would know him, I assume) are familiar, but very few know their stories (again my assumption). Personally, I haven't heard of Rani Chennamma, V.O.C Pillai, and Pazhassi Raja before. I always wondered why there are very few freedom fighters from the southeren part of our country. On the fly, I could list only two names: Alluri Seetharaamaraju, and Tangutoori Prakasam Panthulu. Apparently, I had a very shallow knowledge on the topic. I liked the end-credit song from RRR and got curious as to who these heroes were, whose names I haven't come across in Social Studies text books during my schooling. Wikipedia either has a lot of data or too less of a data about these national heroes. So, I thought it'd be a good idea to put forward, an overview of their stories.
