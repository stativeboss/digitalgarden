- During the lockdown, I took a few [Schoolhouse](https://schoolhouse.world/) sessions on Maths and Physics for JEE. Do check out student feedback from [here](https://schoolhouse.world/u/20151).
- [iTeach schools](http://www.iteachschools.org/) orgainize a Certified Peer Learning Program for eleventh and twelth grade students who cannot afford coaching classes. I was a [mentor](https://bit.ly/3GzeYai) in this program during my stay at Pune. 
- I also teach at [Cuemath](https://www.cuemath.com/) as a hobby. One of my students got selected for the advanced math curriculum in the US. The ratings in [this pic](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xRdzb9btS1BZiZzHywO_P0PuGH3cwZkS/view?usp=sharing) is the parent feedback that I received.
- During my Master's course at NIT Trichy, I was part of the Campus Placement Course (CPC) team. The CPC team creates an 'experience bank' from seniors, and conducts quizes and mock placement procedures for juniors.
