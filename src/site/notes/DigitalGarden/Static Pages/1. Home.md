# Jai Sreeraam
Welcome to my blogsite. You may refer it as a ['Digital garden'](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) as I wish to keep populating it with content and you would see it 'grow'. 

I'm an Electronics Engineer. I like [[DigitalGarden/Static Pages/learning|learning]] things and enjoy [[DigitalGarden/Static Pages/sharing|sharing]] my learnings. Books, discourses, articles, and discussions on philosophy, religion, science and engineering interest me.

I will be using this space to post on these topics.
